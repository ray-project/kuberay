# If rbacEnable is set to false, no RBAC resources will be created, including the Role for leader election, the Role for Pods and Services, and so on.
rbacEnable: true

# When crNamespacedRbacEnable is set to true, the KubeRay operator will create a Role for RayCluster preparation (e.g., Pods, Services)
# and a corresponding RoleBinding for each namespace listed in the "watchNamespace" parameter. Please note that even if crNamespacedRbacEnable
# is set to false, the Role and RoleBinding for leader election will still be created.
#
# Note:
# (1) This variable is only effective when rbacEnable and singleNamespaceInstall are both set to true.
# (2) In most cases, it should be set to true, unless you are using a Kubernetes cluster managed by GitOps tools such as ArgoCD.
crNamespacedRbacEnable: true

# When singleNamespaceInstall is true:
# - Install namespaced RBAC resources such as Role and RoleBinding instead of cluster-scoped ones like ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding so that
#   the chart can be installed by users with permissions restricted to a single namespace.
#   (Please note that this excludes the CRDs, which can only be installed at the cluster scope.)
# - If "watchNamespace" is not set, the KubeRay operator will, by default, only listen
#   to resource events within its own namespace.
singleNamespaceInstall: false

# The KubeRay operator will watch the custom resources in the namespaces listed in the "watchNamespace" parameter.

#   - n1
#   - n2

env:
# If not set or set to true, kuberay auto injects an init container waiting for ray GCS.
