# Enable customized Kubernetes scheduler integration. If enabled, Ray workloads will be scheduled
# by the customized scheduler.
#  * "enabled" is the legacy option and will be deprecated soon.
#  * "name" is the standard option, expecting a scheduler name, supported values are
#    "default", "volcano", and "yunikorn".
#
# Note: "enabled" and "name" should not be set at the same time. If both are set, an error will be thrown.
#
# Examples:
#  1. Use volcano (deprecated)
#       batchScheduler:
#         enabled: true
#
#  2. Use volcano
#       batchScheduler:
#         name: volcano
#
#  3. Use yunikorn
#       batchScheduler:
#         name: yunikorn
#
batchScheduler:
  # Deprecated. This option will be removed in the future.
  # Note, for backwards compatibility. When it sets to true, it enables volcano scheduler integration.
  enabled: false
  # Set the customized scheduler name, supported values are "volcano" or "yunikorn", do not set

# if userKubernetesProxy is set to true, the KubeRay operator will be configured with the --use-kubernetes-proxy flag.

# When crNamespacedRbacEnable is set to true, the KubeRay operator will create a Role for RayCluster preparation (e.g., Pods, Services)
# and a corresponding RoleBinding for each namespace listed in the "watchNamespace" parameter. Please note that even if crNamespacedRbacEnable
# is set to false, the Role and RoleBinding for leader election will still be created.
#
# Note:
# (1) This variable is only effective when rbacEnable and singleNamespaceInstall are both set to true.
# (2) In most cases, it should be set to true, unless you are using a Kubernetes cluster managed by GitOps tools such as ArgoCD.
crNamespacedRbacEnable: true

# When singleNamespaceInstall is true:
# - Install namespaced RBAC resources such as Role and RoleBinding instead of cluster-scoped ones like ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding so that
#   the chart can be installed by users with permissions restricted to a single namespace.
#   (Please note that this excludes the CRDs, which can only be installed at the cluster scope.)

# If not set or set to "", kuberay will pick up the default k8s cluster domain `cluster.local`
# Otherwise, kuberay will use your custom domain
