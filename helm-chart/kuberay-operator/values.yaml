# Enable customized Kubernetes scheduler integration. If enabled, Ray workloads will be scheduled
# by the customized scheduler.
#  * "enabled" is the legacy option and will be deprecated soon.
#  * "name" is the standard option, expecting a scheduler name, supported values are
#    "default", "volcano", "yunikorn", and "scheduler-plugins".
#
# Note: "enabled" and "name" should not be set at the same time. If both are set, an error will be thrown.
#
# Examples:
#  1. Use volcano (deprecated)
#       batchScheduler:
#         enabled: true
#
#  2. Use volcano
#       batchScheduler:

#
#  3. Use yunikorn
#       batchScheduler:
#         name: yunikorn
#
#  4. Use PodGroup
#       batchScheduler:
#         name: scheduler-plugins
#

  # Deprecated. This option will be removed in the future.
  # Note, for backwards compatibility. When it sets to true, it enables volcano scheduler integration.
