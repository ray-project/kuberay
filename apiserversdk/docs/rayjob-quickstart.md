# RayJob QuickStart

This document explains how to manage and interact with RayJob using KubeRay APIServer.
See [this guide](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/getting-started/rayjob-quick-start.html) for more details.

## Step 1: Create a Kubernetes cluster

This step creates a local Kubernetes cluster using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). If you already have a Kubernetes
cluster, you can skip this step.

```sh
kind create cluster --image=kindest/node:v1.26.0
```

## Step 2: Install KubeRay operator and APIServer

Follow the [Installation Guide](installation.md) to install the latest stable KubeRay
operator and APIServer (without the security proxy) from the Helm repository, and
port-forward the HTTP endpoint to local port 31888.

## Step 3: Install a RayJob

Once the KubeRay operator is running, we can install a RayJob through APIServer with
following command. This will create a RayJob named `rayjob-interactive-mode`:

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/kuberay/master/ray-operator/config/samples/ray-job.interactive-mode.yaml \
  | curl -X POST http://localhost:31888/apis/ray.io/v1/namespaces/default/rayjobs \
    -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" \
    --data-binary @-
```

## Step 4: Check RayJob Status

You can check the detail of the submitted RayJob by executing following command:

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:31888/apis/ray.io/v1/namespaces/default/rayjobs/rayjob-interactive-mode
```

## Step 5: Delete the RayJob

To delete the RayJob with KubeRay APIServer, execute the following command. The `rayjob-interactive-mode` is the name of
the RayJob we created.

```sh
curl -X DELETE 'localhost:31888/apis/ray.io/v1/namespaces/default/rayjobs/rayjob-interactive-mode'
```

You can then verify if the RayJob is removed. The following command should return 404:

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:31888/apis/ray.io/v1/namespaces/default/rayjobs/rayjob-interactive-mode
```

## Clean up

```sh
kind delete cluster
```
