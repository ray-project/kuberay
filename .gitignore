# According to Go official documentation (https://go.dev/ref/mod):
#
# "It is generally inadvisable to commit go.work files into version control systems,
# for two reasons:
#
# 1. A checked-in go.work file might override a developer's own go.work file from a
#    parent directory, causing confusion when their use directives don't apply.
#
# 2. A checked-in go.work file may cause a continuous integration (CI) system to
#    select and thus test the wrong versions of a module's dependencies. CI systems
#    should generally not be allowed to use the go.work file so that they can test
#    the behavior of the module as it would be used when required by other modules,
#    where a go.work file within the module has no effect.
#
# That said, there are some cases where committing a go.work file makes sense.
# For example, when the modules in a repository are developed exclusively with
# each other but not together with external modules, there may not be a reason
# the developer would want to use a different combination of modules in a workspace.
# In that case, the module author should ensure the individual modules are tested
# and released properly."
