# Test Overrides Overlay (CI / e2e ONLY)

This overlay enables test-only / alpha feature gates (currently `RayJobDeletionPolicy`) without modifying:
- The base manifests under `config/default`
- Generated CRDs (`make generate`)
- Helm chart defaults (`make helm`, users' `helm install` without -f override)

Use it only in CI or local end-to-end testing when you explicitly need gated behavior.

---
## Why It Exists
Some feature gates are intentionally disabled by default for stability. E2E tests must exercise them to validate behavior prior to promotion. This overlay provides a safe, isolated place to turn them on.

---
## Safety Guarantees
| Concern | Guarantee |
|---------|-----------|
| Default user deploy (`make deploy`) | Unchanged |
| Helm install (no -f override) | Unchanged |
| CRD generation / codegen | Unaffected |
| Feature gates scope | Only those explicitly listed here |

---
## Usage
Deploy with feature gates enabled:
```
make deploy-with-override IMG=kuberay/operator:nightly
```
Helm path (CI release automation):
```
helm install kuberay-operator kuberay/kuberay-operator -f .buildkite/values-kuberay-operator-override.yaml
```

---
## Adding Another Feature Gate
1. Edit `deployment-override.yaml` – append your gate inside the existing `--feature-gates=` list.
2. Update `.buildkite/values-kuberay-operator-override.yaml` likewise.
3. Add or adjust e2e tests as needed.

Keep gate ordering stable to minimize diff noise.

---
## Keeping In Sync
If the base operator Deployment args change in `config/manager/manager.yaml`:
1. Copy the updated arg list.
2. Re-apply the feature gates in `deployment-override.yaml`.
3. Re-render to confirm.

---
## Removal / Promotion Flow
When a gate graduates (enabled by default upstream):
1. Remove it from the override (if it's default-on, it no longer needs listing).
2. Remove corresponding logic from tests if they branch on gate state.
3. (Optional) Note the graduation in release notes.

---
## Troubleshooting
Problem | Action
--------|-------
Patch no longer applies | Check if Deployment name or container name changed.
Gates not taking effect | Confirm args rendered (render target) and operator pod restarted.
Unexpected arg order | The strategic merge patch replaces the entire args list; adjust ordering there.

---
## Do NOT
- Add unrelated production configuration (RBAC, CRDs, resources) here.
- Reference this overlay from user-facing docs.
- Rename directory without updating `Makefile` targets.
