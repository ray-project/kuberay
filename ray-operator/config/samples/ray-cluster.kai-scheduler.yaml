# KAI Scheduler Example - Basic RayCluster
# KAI Scheduler uses a hierarchical queue system for resource management and fair sharing.
# These queues must be created before any RayCluster can be scheduled by KAI.

# NOTE: This is a DEMO configuration with unlimited quotas (-1) for easy testing.
# In real-world deployments, you should set appropriate CPU/GPU/memory quotas and limits
# based on your cluster's actual resources and organizational needs.

# Parent queue: Represents a department or high-level organizational unit
apiVersion: scheduling.run.ai/v2
kind: Queue
metadata:
  name: department-1
spec:
  # priority: 100  # Optional: Higher priority queues get surplus resources first
  resources:
    cpu:
      quota: -1 # Unlimited quota (demo setting)
      limit: -1 # Unlimited burst limit (demo setting)
      overQuotaWeight: 1 # Determines how leftover (surplus) CPU resources are distributed among
      # queues that have the same priority. Higher weights receive larger portion
    gpu:
      quota: -1 # Unlimited quota (demo setting)
      limit: -1 # Unlimited burst limit (demo setting)
      overQuotaWeight: 1 # Share of surplus resources among same-priority queues

      quota: -1 # Unlimited quota (demo setting)
      limit: -1 # Unlimited burst limit (demo setting)
      overQuotaWeight: 1 # Share of surplus resources among same-priority queues

# Child queue: Represents a team within the department-1
apiVersion: scheduling.run.ai/v2
kind: Queue
