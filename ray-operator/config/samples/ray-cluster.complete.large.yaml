# For most use-cases, it makes sense to schedule one Ray pod per Kubernetes node.
# This is a configuration for a RayCluster with 1 Ray head pod and 1 Ray worker pod.
# Each pod requests 54 Gi memory and 14 CPU.
# Each pod can be scheduled on a virtual machine with roughly 64 Gi memory and 16 CPU.
# (AWS: m5.4xlarge, GCP: e2-standard-16, Azure: Standard_D5_v2)
# Optimal resource allocation will depend on your Kubernetes infrastructure and might
# require some experimentation.
