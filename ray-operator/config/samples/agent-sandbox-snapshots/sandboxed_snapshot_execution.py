"""
Demonstrates suspending and resuming Agent Sandbox pods with GKE Pod
Snapshots from a Ray job.

Each SandboxExecutor actor drives a simulated multi-turn agent rollout: at
the turn boundary — the moment it has a command result and is waiting on the
model — it suspends its sandbox (memory snapshot + pod termination, freeing
the pod's resource reservation) and resumes it before the next turn. The
snapshot restores the sandbox intact: the second turn reads state that the
first turn wrote to /tmp, which only survives because the whole guest
(memory, process tree, tmpfs) was checkpointed — a plain pod restart would
have wiped it.
