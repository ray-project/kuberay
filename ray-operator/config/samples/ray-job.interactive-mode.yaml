spec:
  # InteractiveMode means KubeRay doesn't submit the job for you.
  # KubeRay will create the RayJob and transition it to the Waiting state.
  # The user needs to submit the job manually via the `ray job submit` command
  # and then update the `spec.jobId` field with the job ID.
  # After that, KubeRay will handle the rest of the lifecycle for the RayJob.
  submissionMode: InteractiveMode
