# KubeRay Pod Pool Virtual Kubelet

KubeRay Pod Pool Virtual Kubelet is an optional and standalone component of the KubeRay Ecosystem.
It provides warmed-up pod pools by registering itself as a virtual kubelet to a Kubernetes cluster.
When KubeRay requests pods from the virtual kubelet,
the actual pods are taken from one of the pod pools specified by the users and effectively skip:

* resource scheduling time
* image pulling time
* volume preparation time
because those pods are already active and waiting in pools.
