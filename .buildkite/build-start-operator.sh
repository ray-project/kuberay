# to kick off from the release branch so tests should match up accordingly.

# NOTE: Do not enable `set -u` (nounset) here. This script is sourced by the
# Buildkite steps, so shell options propagate to the caller; downstream steps
# reference $KUBERAY_TEST_RAY_IMAGE without a default and would fail under -u
# when the variable is not set (e.g. in the non-release path).
