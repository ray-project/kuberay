# KubeRay Community Governance

There are 4 roles in the KubeRay community:

* **Contributor**: A contributor is a member who contributes to the KubeRay project through code, documentation,
PR reviews, answering questions, etc.
* **Triager**: A triager has the permission to triage issues and PRs.
* **Reviewer**: A reviewer can review PRs but cannot merge them.
* **Committer**: A committer can merge PRs and is responsible for the KubeRay project.

## Mechanism

### Becoming a Contributor

To become a KubeRay contributor, you can contribute to KubeRay through code, documentation, PR reviews,
answering questions, and more.
It's helpful to join the KubeRay channel `#kuberay-questions` on the [Ray Slack workspace](https://github.com/ray-project/ray?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-involved)
to get started. You can also read [ray-project/kuberay#1059](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/issues/1059)
for tips on getting involved in the KubeRay community.

In addition, you can add the
[Ray / KubeRay OSS community Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19iZWIwYTUxZDQyZTczMTFmZWFmYTY5YjZiOTY1NjAxMTQ3ZTEzOTAxZWE0ZGU5YzA1NjFlZWQ5OTljY2FiOWM4QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)
to your calendar and join the bi-weekly KubeRay community meetings.

### Becoming a Triager

A triager helps manage issues and PRs by assigning them to the appropriate people and adding labels to categorize them.
To become a triager, you should demonstrate a basic understanding of the overall KubeRay project
so you can determine whether an issue or PR is valid and how to categorize it.

### Becoming a Reviewer

To become a KubeRay reviewer, you should demonstrate a deep understanding of certain features
or components of the KubeRay project.
A reviewer should be able to review PRs and provide constructive feedback to help the author
improve the PR. Ideally, committers should feel confident merging a PR if you have approved it.

### Becoming a Committer

Nothing in this document is guaranteed, but it provides a clear path for contributors toward becoming committers.

A committer is a trusted member of the KubeRay community with a long-term commitment who has the ownership to
offload the community's workloads and make KubeRay thrive. To elaborate,

* **Offload community’s workloads:** A committer should be able to deliver high-quality code which doesn’t require a lot
  of code reviews, uphold high-quality code reviews, answer questions on GitHub and Slack, and release new KubeRay
  releases to offload the community’s workloads.
* **Make KubeRay thrive:** There are two main indicators that define the vibrancy of the KubeRay community:
  (1) active contributors and (2) user adoptions.
  * **Involve more contributors:** A committer should be able to involve more contributors by providing mentorship or
    reviewing PRs.
  * **Increase user adoptions:** A committer should be able to find user pain points and unlock new use cases by
    delivering new features, help users by answering questions and fixing bugs, author blogs, and give talks.

If contributors commit to the above two areas with long-term contributions, they will be nominated as KubeRay committers.
The following paragraphs provide methods and more details about how to contribute to the two areas, and the order does not
indicate importance.
A contributor doesn't need to contribute to all of them to be a committer, and nothing is strictly required to be a
committer, but all of them will be considered together.

* **Code contribution:**
  * Deliver high-quality code that committers are comfortable merging without a lot of back-and-forth on PR reviews.
  * End-to-end ownership of new features is also important; that is, writing user guides and advertising new features
    after PRs are merged to ensure users can actually use them in production.
* **PR reviews:**
  * Uphold high-quality code reviews, and committers are confident in merging the PR if you approve it.
* **Answer questions:**
  * Answer questions on Slack and GitHub issues to unblock users.
* **Mentorship:**
  * Mentor contributors to be involved in the community.
* **Advocacy:**
  * Improve KubeRay's awareness within the AI infrastructure and cloud-native communities by speaking at conferences and
    writing blogs.
* **KubeRay releases:**
  * Help KubeRay releases ensure high-quality and stable KubeRay releases.
* **Understand user pain points and propose new projects:**
  * Chat with users to understand their pain points and propose new projects or documents to unlock new use cases.
