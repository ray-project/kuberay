## KubeRay

> We have moved all documentation to the [ray-project/ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) repository.
Please refer to the [Ray docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/index.html) for the latest information.
The [ray-project/kuberay](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay) repository hosts the KubeRay source code and community information.

KubeRay is a powerful, open-source Kubernetes operator that simplifies the deployment and management of [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) applications on Kubernetes. It offers several key components:

**KubeRay core**: This is the official, fully-maintained component of KubeRay that provides three custom resource definitions, RayCluster, RayJob, and RayService. These resources are designed to help you run a wide range of workloads with ease.

* **RayCluster**: KubeRay fully manages the lifecycle of RayCluster, including cluster creation/deletion, autoscaling, and ensuring fault tolerance.

* **RayJob**: With RayJob, KubeRay automatically creates a RayCluster and submits a job when the cluster is ready. You can also configure RayJob to automatically delete the RayCluster once the job finishes.

* **RayService**: RayService is made up of two parts: a RayCluster and a Ray Serve deployment graph. RayService offers zero-downtime upgrades for RayCluster and high availability.

**KubeRay ecosystem**: Some optional components.

* **Kubectl Plugin** (Beta): Starting from KubeRay v1.3.0, you can use the `kubectl ray` plugin to simplify
common workflows when deploying Ray on Kubernetes. If you arenâ€™t familiar with Kubernetes, this
plugin simplifies running Ray on Kubernetes. See [kubectl-plugin](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/user-guides/kubectl-plugin.html#kubectl-plugin) for more details.

* **KubeRay APIServer** (Alpha): It provides a layer of simplified configuration for KubeRay resources. The KubeRay API server is used internally
by some organizations to back user interfaces for KubeRay resource management.

* **KubeRay Dashboard** (Experimental): Starting from KubeRay v1.4.0, we have introduced a new dashboard that enables users to view and manage KubeRay resources.
While it is not yet production-ready, we welcome your feedback.
